This app is a basic Quiz app which I created via Kotlin in Android Studio 4.1.1 . The app is static i.e type and number of questions remain the same .I learnt the functioning of 
Scroll views and various Material Components in XML . I learnt how to communicate between different android activities and how to retireve and send data . This project also taught me
in detail about the data classes, objects & functions in Kotlin . I have attached screenshots of the app as well
